# Data Platform Database Migrations

## TODOs

1. Set up branching (main, staging, and everything else later)
2. Create first DDL to create map, agent and patch tables for valorant data
3. Create tables in BQ for valorant scraping of vlr.gg
4. Setup workflow ci/cd for testing new merges on push (in staging env)
5. Setup workflow ci/cd for publishing changes to production (main branch)
